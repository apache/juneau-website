      sophisticated REST interfaces.

    <description>
 	  Apache Juneau is a single cohesive framework consisting of the following parts:
		1) A universal toolkit for marshalling POJOs to a wide variety of content types using a common framework.
		2) A universal REST server API for creating Swagger-based self-documenting REST interfaces using POJOs, simply deployed as 
				one or more top-level servlets in any Servlet 3.1.0+ container.
		3) A universal REST client API for interacting with Juneau or 3rd-party REST interfaces using POJOs and proxy interfaces.
		4) A sophisticated configuration file API.
		5) A REST microservice API that combines all the features above with a simple configurable Jetty server for 
				creating lightweight standalone REST interfaces that start up in milliseconds.
		6) Built on top of Servlet and Apache HttpClient APIs that allow you to use the newest HTTP/2 features
				such as request/response multiplexing and server push.
